git init
Makes a git repository in the file, hidden by default. Use this in order to do commands

git add .
Adds all the files in the folder to be commited

git status
Shows you wich files are added or modified/changed to be commited

git commit "Some Note here*
Commits the added files. The comment is optional, but used as a note

git add *.html
Adds a new .html file to the file

touch .gitignore
Adds a file called ".gitignore", where you change to add the names of files to ignore in the file. Useful when using "git add .", so it won't add specific files in the same file

touch log.txt
Adds a file name into .gitignore, which then ignores the "log.txt" file

Inside the .gitignore file, you add file names like this
log.txt
For files inside the file
/folder1
For folders inside the file
*.txt
For any .txt file in the file
